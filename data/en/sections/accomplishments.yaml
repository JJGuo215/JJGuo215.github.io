- name: 2 Years Working Holiday in Australia
  courseOverview: In 2017, I started my working holiday in Australia. I travelled to different places and tried different interesting jobs. In Sydney, I was selling dumplings in the food festival. In Mataranka, I worked as an all-rounder in a roadhouse which is in the middle of nowhere. I really admire the wildness and aboriginal culture of Northern Territory. In Adelaide, I was a receptionist in a hostel where I met so many young people from different countries of the world. In Melbourne, I worked in a restaurant and enjoyed the delicious food of the city. Two yearâ€™s working-holiday really help me to fit in the Aussie culture.

- name: Travelling Around the World
  courseOverview: I like travelling and I have been to more than 30 countries. In 2016, I spent the whole year travelling responsibly. In India, I worked in Mother House to help people who were dying and children with disabilities. In Iran, Lebanon, and Jordan, I explored the mysteriousness of the Middle East. Also, I am a full-course marathon (42km) runner. The most impressive one is along the DMZ area between the South and North Korea. The persistence is always a treasure. I would like to tell you more stories about me if there is a chance.
